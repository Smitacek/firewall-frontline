# Firewall Frontline

## Tagline
"Defend the network, outsmart the attacks."

## Vision
*Firewall Frontline* is a light‑hearted 2 D lane‑defense game that teaches essential cybersecurity concepts through approachable *Plants‑vs‑Zombies*‑style mechanics. Players build and upgrade defensive software modules to repel increasingly sophisticated waves of malware and hacker tools, learning real‑world security principles along the way.

## Genre & References
- **Tower / Lane Defense**
- **Inspirations:** *Plants vs Zombies* (PopCap, 2009) for lane‑based clarity and progressive unlocks; *Into the Breach* for tactical depth; mini‑CTF challenges for thematic authenticity.

## Core Loop
1. **Collect CPU cycles** generated by Power Nodes.
2. **Deploy defensive modules** (Firewall, IDS, Honeypot, Sandbox) onto network lanes.
3. **Repel incoming attack packets;** gain XP & Research Tokens.
4. **Invest tokens** to unlock stronger modules & passive buffs.
5. **Survive the wave;** advance to the next scenario with new attack vectors.

## Key System – Cyber‑Security Modules vs Attack Waves
- **Defensive modules** are autonomous "Agents" with cost, cooldown and upgrade path.
- **Attack waves** contain enemy types (Script Kiddie, Botnet Swarm, Phishing Spear, Zero‑Day APT Boss) with unique resistances and special abilities.
- **Damage channels** map to real security layers: *Packet*, *Payload*, *Social*, *Zero‑Day*.
- **Failsafe device** (Air‑Gap Trigger) cleans an entire lane once, mirroring PvZ lawn‑mower.

## Thematic Pillars
| Pillar | Meaning in Game |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Accessible Cybersecurity** | Mechanics illustrate defence‑in‑depth, least privilege, patching cadence. |
| **Asymmetric Warfare** | One attacker AI vs human defender; escalating threat tiers. |
| **Humour & Neon‑Retro Style** | Playful pixel art, meme references, clear silhouettes for readability. |

## Target Audience
Casual PC players & IT / CS students (ages 13–30) curious about security.

## Platform & Tech Constraints
- Desktop (Windows & Linux) – Godot **4.x LTS**.
- Headless build must compile via CI on every push.
- All third‑party assets require CC0 / CC‑BY licences recorded in `resources.md`.

## Unique Selling Points
- **Learn by playing:** each enemy tooltip explains the real‑world attack it represents.
- **Pick‑your‑toolbox:** pre‑wave load‑out fosters strategic planning.
- **One‑more‑wave feel:** short 3–5 min levels with escalating variety.

## Stretch Goals
- Local co‑op (dual analysts share resource pool).
- Procedurally generated "Red‑Team Campaign" mode.
- Steam Workshop for custom enemy / module scripts.

## Inspirations / Moodboard Keywords
*Plants vs Zombies*, DEFCON CTF posters, *Tron: Legacy* colour palette, neon terminal grids.

### Next Steps
- Set up GitHub repository with Godot 4.x template and `.gitignore`.
- Copy this `idea.md` into repo root.
- Break down **vertical slice** tasks into GitHub Issues (< 8 h each).
- Prepare placeholder sprites for: Power Node, Firewall, Script Kiddie.
- Draft initial **GDD.md** skeleton (mechanics, UI wireframes, level flow).
